# Developer Website Portfolio

## User Story
- AS AN employer
- I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
- SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## First Steps Creating a Junior Developer Portfolio
- Considering the acceptance criterias, I've:
- Created a responsive initial website
- Used html and css to create this first version

## Future Improvements

- Improve portfolio display;
-  Add new projects to the page and link the current empty blocks to these new projects;
- Add Java Scripts for a more interactive page.
